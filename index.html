          <p>Meditation is the art of clearing the mind.  There are many different forms of meditation.  Some you will resonate with and others you may find yourself completely disinterested in, and that is okay!  We just need to get you to learn how to quiet your mind every day for 5-15 minutes and you will find your life improving.  Remember, this is a practice; no one is ever perfect but you will get better.</p>
